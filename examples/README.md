# Examples

This is examples folder. Each example is linked to webserver.js, which *requires* express.js to run.
Express.js **was not** inserted as dipendency.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexandercerutti/passkit-generator.git;
npm install;
npm install express;
cd examples;
node <the-example-you-want-to-execute>.js
```
