# Examples

This is examples folder. Each example is linked to webserver.js, which **requires express.js** to run.

Since just examples, Express.js was not inserted as dipendency. Therefore install it to test.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexandercerutti/passkit-generator.git;
npm install;
npm install express;
cd examples;
node <the-example-you-want-to-execute>.js
```
